Past: 
	 This is my final semester at SUNY New Paltz. I now have about 2 years of experience in learning Computer Science concepts 
   and programming because my undergrad was in Communication Disorders. I have programmed in Java, Python, and C/C++. 
   I have strong knowledge in html and basic knowledge of CSS.  When it comes to adding in CSS and JavaScript, I need to improve.
   In past semesters, I have been a teaching assistant for CS1 and Language Processing. I currently am a teaching assistant 
   for Language Processing again and am assigned as extra help for general Linux questions. I have taken Database Design, 
   Compiler Design, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Programming and Data Structures, Database management, and System on Chip.
   Projects I am currently working on is building a backend for LLVM to support RISC-V and attempting to build an Alexa Skill.
   Although, every time I start back on the skill, I get freaked out thinking about how many of the devices we use invade our 
   privacy and then I stop. Perhaps I should decide on another project!
Future:
 I am taking this class because I know the skills learned in this class are 
 essential to full stack engineering positions. Although I hope to find myself in company working with 
 the lower level side of machines such as operating systems or compilers, I will be happy to find a career
 in any area of computers. This field is a never-ending cycle of constantly learning the latest and greatest software tools
 and programming languages, which is one of the reasons why I decided to pursue this field! So, if I end up in a career 
 where I am involved, improving my skills, and feel respected/valued I will be content.
