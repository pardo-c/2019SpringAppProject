Past: 
	 This is my final semester at SUNY New Paltz. I now have about 2 years of experience in learning Computer Science concepts 
   and programming because my undergrad was in Communication Disorders. I have programmed in Java, Python, and C/C++. 
   I have strong knowledge in html and basic knowledge of CSS.  When it comes to adding in CSS and JavaScript, I need to improve.
   In past semesters, I have been a teaching assistant for CS1 and Language Processing. I currently am a teaching assistant 
   for Language Processing again and am assigned as extra help for general Linux questions. I have taken Database Design, 
   Compiler Design, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Programming and Data Structures, Database management, and System on Chip.
Future:
 I am taking this class because I know the skills learned in this class are 
 essential to full stack engineering positions.

App Ideas:

Name: Living Forward
Description: I do not want to create just an exercise app, I want it to involve mental health and dogs. Such as uploading feel good stories on the exercise you did that day made your life a little bit better or uploading pictures of people exercising with their pets.
